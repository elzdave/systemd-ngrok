# SystemD Ngrok

## Warning: This repository is outdated and will not be maintained anymore.

I make a rewrite about Ngrok service installer/uninstaller in Linux on another repository. It has domain support and ngrok's native service installer. You can find it [here](https://github.com/elzdave/script-album/tree/main/Ngrok-Linux-Service).
